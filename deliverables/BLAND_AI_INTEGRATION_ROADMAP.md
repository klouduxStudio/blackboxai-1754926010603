## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Enhancements

- Implement webhook integrations for external system triggers
- Add support for knowledge base integration and dynamic data fetching
- Enable fine-tuning and training of conversational pathways via admin UI
- Implement multi-language support and localization
- Add detailed logging and audit trails for AI interactions

---

## Phase 5: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment

- Conduct comprehensive unit, integration, and UI testing
- Perform load and performance testing for scalability
- Optimize API response times and frontend rendering
- Prepare deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines
- Deploy to staging environment for user acceptance testing
- Finalize production deployment and monitoring setup

---

## Phase 6: Post-Deployment Support and Iteration
