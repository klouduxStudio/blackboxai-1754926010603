## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install, configure, and maintain the Explorer Shack booking system on a cPanel web hosting environment. It covers prerequisites, deployment, database setup, configuration, and best practices for smooth operation.

---

## Prerequisites

- cPanel access with File Manager, MySQL Database Wizard, and Terminal (SSH) access.
- PHP version 7.4 or higher (if applicable).
- Node.js installed on the server (for backend services).
- MySQL or MariaDB database.
- FTP or SFTP access for file uploads.
- SSL certificate configured for secure HTTPS access.

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Upload Project Files

- Use cPanel File Manager or FTP client to upload the entire project directory to the desired location (e.g., `public_html` or a subfolder).
- Ensure all files and folders are uploaded with correct permissions (typically 755 for folders, 644 for files).
### 2. Database Setup

- Open cPanel MySQL Database Wizard.
- Create a new database and database user with a strong password.
- Assign the user to the database with all privileges.
- Import the initial database schema and seed data using phpMyAdmin or command line:
  ```
  mysql -u username -p database_name < path/to/schema.sql
  ```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

- Edit the configuration files (e.g., `.env` or config files in backend) to set:
  - Database connection details.
  - SMTP email settings.
  - API keys and secrets.
  - Other system settings as per `control-center`.

### 4. Install Dependencies

- Access the server terminal via cPanel or SSH.
- Navigate to the backend directory:
  ```
  cd path/to/project/backend
  ```
- Install Node.js dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Repeat for frontend and admin directories if applicable.

### 5. Build and Start Services

- Build frontend assets:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
- Start backend server:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
- Configure process manager (e.g., PM2) for persistent backend service:
  ```
  pm2 start backend/dist/server.js --name explorer-shack-backend
  pm2 save
  pm2 startup
  ```

### 6. Configure Cron Jobs

- Set up cron jobs in cPanel for scheduled tasks such as:
  - Ticket triggering.
  - Email notifications.
  - Data cleanup.
- Example cron command:
  ```
  cd path/to/project/backend && node scripts/ticket-trigger.js
  ```

### 7. SSL and Domain Setup

- Ensure SSL certificate is installed and active.
- Configure domain/subdomain to point to the project directory.
- Force HTTPS redirection in `.htaccess` or server settings.

---

## Maintenance

### Backup

- Schedule regular backups of:
  - Database (via cPanel Backup Wizard or mysqldump).
  - Uploaded files and media.
- Store backups securely offsite.

### Updates and Deployment

- Use the Control Centerâ€™s update feature to upload new development files and instruction files.
- Alternatively, upload updated files via FTP and run migration scripts.
- Use version control and maintain changelogs.
- Test updates in a staging environment before production deployment.

### Security

- Regularly update dependencies and server software.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Enforce strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
- Limit access to admin and backend services.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Check server error logs via cPanel.
- Verify database connectivity and credentials.
- Ensure correct file permissions.
- Restart backend services if unresponsive.
